FitZone Final Polished Package (NO HD images included)
=====================================================

This package contains the FitZone website (polished UI, modern theme, JSON-driven trainers/events,
CSV submission storage, secure authentication, admin protection, and responsive layout).

Important notes:
- I could not download HD stock images inside this environment. Placeholder images are included.
- To include HD images, upload them into the images/ folder in the project root and name them:
  hero.jpg, trainer1.jpg, trainer2.jpg, trainer3.jpg, event1.jpg, event2.jpg, member1.jpg, member2.jpg, member3.jpg, map.jpg, plan_basic.png, plan_standard.png, plan_premium.png
- Database: php/db.php points to 'fitzone_db' (host=localhost, user=root, password=''). Update as needed.
- Create demo users: open php/create_demo_users.php in your browser after creating the DB.

Files of interest:
- php/register.php, php/login.php, php/create_demo_users.php, php/db.php
- data/trainers.json, data/events.json, data/submissions.csv
- css/style.css, js/ui_interactions.js, js/load_json.js
- final_linkfix_report.txt (detailed fix log)

If you want, upload the HD images and I will insert them into the project and repackage a final ZIP with true HD images embedded.
